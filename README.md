# ML-model-deployment-to-Flask-webapp

A K Nearest Neighbor model has been trained and tuned, then used to make predictions on energy associated with radioactive decay (Q) data.
We went further to deploy this model as an API running on a simple webapp developed using Flask.
The goal of this is to create an interface where a user can interact with the KNN model to get predicitions.
The code that was used to build the KNN model and webapp has been included.
The html file has also been included.

Please note that this project is incomplete, as it only works on the localhost for now.
The next step is to put it in a docker container and deploy it to the cloud via AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
